        <h2>It's Almost Year End!</h2>
        <p>
            Let's count our blessings! The Year 2021 has being a very fruitful and eventful year for us at JTFS. Although we are hit by the effects fo the global COVID-19 pandemic,
            we still are able to achieve more than 70% of our goals.
            <br> We were able to purchase school supplies for at least 1000 kids around 5 West African countries, we provided school uniforms and shoes to other kids as well.
            <br> What was our most successful story of yer 2021 is ability to partner with major companies and individuals to provide Internet services to kids for E-learning. Cometacom was gracious enough to provide a VSAT Internet service to one community
            where kids assemble to learn on computers (donated by another partner!!).

        </p>
        <h2>We are not relenting</h2>
        <p>
            We have set goals for the year 2022; fiscal goals as well as impact goals. The beautiful thing about the environment we operate at is that food and supplies are very cheap. What this means is that, with the barest minimum donations from our partners, we are able to achieve a lot in Africa.
            <br> For instance, donations as little as $10 from individuals per year is able to provide school uniform for a kid. Yes, that is right, $10 will buy a shirt and a short for a school kid, with some changes left to buy some books.
